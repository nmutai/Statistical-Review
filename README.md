# Statistical-Review
The included notes are based upon the Eberly College of Science's Stats 501 class notes on Regression Methods. 
These notes were originally reorganized and supplemented by Dr. Iain Pardoe, based on original notes by Dr. Laura Simon 
and Dr. Derek Young. The original examples utilized Minitab but have been (still ongoing) replaced with original R code
written by Allen Baumgardner-Zuzik
