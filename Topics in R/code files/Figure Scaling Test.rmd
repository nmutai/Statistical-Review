How to ensure that plots look the way you want them when compile in markdown?

```{r}
plot(cars)
legend("topleft",inset=0.02,pch=21:23,pt.bg=c("white","grey","black"),legend=c("Testing 1","Testing 2","Testing 3"))
```

This chunk is not evaluated, but when run from the console creates a plot in a separate window.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
quartz(width=5,height=4) # on Windows use X11() rather than quartz()
plot(cars)
legend("topleft",inset=0.02,pch=21:23,pt.bg=c("white","grey","black"),legend=c("Testing 1","Testing 2","Testing 3"))
abline(v=10,lty=3)
```

If we specify the same size for the figure does it look the same?

```{r fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
plot(cars)
legend("topleft",inset=0.02,pch=21:23,pt.bg=c("white","grey","black"),legend=c("Testing 1","Testing 2","Testing 3"))
abline(v=10,lty=3)
```

Yes, the vertical line on 10 just hits the edge of the legend.
